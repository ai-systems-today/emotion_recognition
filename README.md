# Facial Emotion Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks
Demo Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fRp408fauI

1. Dataset include JAFFE, CK+ and a personalised dataset of illumination variant images
2. Pre-processing included cropping and alignment to face using Multi-Task Cascaded Neural Networks (MTCNNs).
3. Images are converted to Grayscale with application of Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE).
4. CNN used is VGG-16.
5. Trained on CPU mode on Caffe. Used Python 2.7.
